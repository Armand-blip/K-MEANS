# K-MEANS
A sequential and parallel version of K-Means Clustering Algorithm in C++.
In this project I want to describe better the difference between a sequential program 
and a parallel program. Specifically, the aim of this report is to verify these theoretical aspects by comparing 
the execution time of the K-means algorithm with different datasets sizes when using only one core of computation 
and when using multiple ones. 
By adopting different computing techniques, we make use of more than one single thread for the execution and computation of the algorithm.
